# FAIR² Portal Open Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to the repository for **Open Jupyter Notebooks** supporting the **FAIR² Data Packages**. Each notebook provides an example of how to access and analyze the **FAIR² Data Package** associated with published **FAIR² Data Articles**. These notebooks demonstrate workflows for interacting with FAIR²-compliant datasets, enabling researchers to explore, visualize, and integrate data into their research.

## 📚 About FAIR² Data Packages

**FAIR² Data Packages** are comprehensive, FAIR-compliant datasets that extend the original FAIR principles by introducing:

- **AI-Readiness**: Optimized datasets for machine learning workflows.
- **Responsible AI Alignment**: Ensuring ethical and transparent data use.
- **Context-Rich Documentation**: Including provenance, methodologies, and detailed descriptions to ensure deep reusability.

These data packages accompany **FAIR² Data Articles** and are designed to make datasets not only findable and reusable but also interpretable and ready for advanced analysis.

## 🚀 Features of the Notebooks

- **Real-World Examples**: Demonstrations of how to access and analyze FAIR² Data Packages.
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Step-by-step instructions for exploring and processing data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots and charts to help make sense of the data.
- **Integration Tutorials**: Examples of how to integrate FAIR² datasets into external tools, APIs, and machine learning workflows.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each notebook is stored in a directory named after the DOI of its FAIR² Data Package, which also identifies the associated FAIR² Data Article.

```plaintext
/
├── 10.71728/
│   └── senscience.qs2f-h81p/      # Directory for the dataset 10.71728/senscience.qs2f-h81p
│       └── notebook.ipynb         # The Jupyter Notebook
├── README.md                      # This file
└── LICENSE                        # License for the repository
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.11)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senscience/notebooks.git
   cd notebooks
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open the desired notebook file from its corresponding directory to start exploring. Each notebook installs the Python packages it needs in its first cell.

### Running in Google Colab

You can open any notebook directly in **Google Colab** without setting up a local environment.

1. **Locate the Notebook File:**  
   Navigate to the desired `.ipynb` notebook file in the repository on GitHub.

2. **Open in Google Colab:**
   - Click on the notebook file in the GitHub repository.
   - Copy the notebook’s URL from your browser.
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - In Colab, select **File > Open Notebook**.
   - In the pop-up window, go to the **GitHub** tab, paste the notebook's URL, and press **Enter**.
   - Alternatively, you can directly modify the URL to prepend `https://colab.research.google.com/github/`.  
     For example:  
     ```text
     https://colab.research.google.com/github/senscience/notebooks/blob/main/10.71728/senscience.qs2f-h81p/notebook.ipynb
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Colab will automatically set up the environment.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to access and analyze the associated FAIR² Data Package.
