    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This dataset, from Gold et al. (2024), provides a harmonized, multi-site collection of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI data from a preclinical rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). It addresses a key challenge in neuroimaging: the variability introduced by different imaging sites and acquisition protocols. Using the NeuroCombat harmonization technique, the authors corrected for site effects, enabling more robust and reproducible analyses of TBI-related brain changes.\n",

By loading the data via its FAIR² Croissant description, we were able to quickly access and structure it for analysis. Our exploratory analysis replicated several key findings from the associated data article by Gold et al., demonstrating the effectiveness of the data harmonization and the clear biological signals related to traumatic brain injury. This dataset is a valuable, AI-ready resource that can power more robust and reproducible research, ultimately aiding in the discovery and validation of TBI biomarkers."
